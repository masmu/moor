Note: :warning: [As of version 2.0.0, `moar` has been renamed to
`moor`](https://github.com/walles/moor/releases/tag/v2.0.0), but is otherwise
the same tool.

[![Linux CI](https://github.com/walles/moor/actions/workflows/linux-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/walles/moor/actions/workflows/linux-ci.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)

Moor is a pager. It reads and displays UTF-8 encoded text from files or pipes.

`moor` is designed to just do the right thing without any configuration:

![Moor displaying its own source code](screenshot.png)

The intention is that Moor should be trivial to get into if you have previously
been using [Less](http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/). If you come from Less
and find Moor confusing or hard to migrate to, [please report
it](https://github.com/walles/moor/issues)!

Doing the right thing includes:

- **Syntax highlight** source code by default using
  [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma)
- **Search is incremental** / find-as-you-type just like in
  [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) or
  [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
- **Filtering is incremental**: Press <kbd>&</kbd> to filter the input
  interactively
- Search becomes case sensitive if you add any UPPER CASE characters
  to your search terms, just like in Emacs
- [Regexp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Basic_concepts)
  search if your search string is a valid regexp
- **Snappy UI** even on slow / large input by reading input in the background
  and using multi-threaded search
- Supports displaying ANSI color coded texts (like the output from
  `git diff` [| `riff`](https://github.com/walles/riff) for example)
- Supports UTF-8 input and output
- **Transparent decompression** when viewing [compressed text
  files](https://github.com/walles/moor/issues/97#issuecomment-1191415680)
  (`.gz`, `.bz2`, `.xz`, `.zst`, `.zstd`) or [streams](https://github.com/walles/moor/issues/261)
- The position in the file is always shown
- Supports **word wrapping** (on actual word boundaries) if requested using
  `--wrap` or by pressing <kbd>w</kbd>
- [**Follows output** as long as you are on the last line](https://github.com/walles/moor/issues/108#issuecomment-1331743242),
  just like `tail -f`
- Renders [terminal
  hyperlinks](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda)
  properly
- **Mouse Scrolling** works out of the box (but
  [look here for tradeoffs](https://github.com/walles/moor/blob/master/MOUSE.md))

[For compatibility reasons](https://github.com/walles/moor/issues/14), `moor`
uses the formats declared in these environment variables if present:

- `LESS_TERMCAP_md`: Man page <b>bold</b>
- `LESS_TERMCAP_us`: Man page <u>underline</u>
- `LESS_TERMCAP_so`: [Status bar and search hits](https://github.com/walles/moor/issues/114)

For configurability reasons, `moor` reads extra command line options from the
`MOOR` environment variable.

Moor is used as the default pager by:

- [`px` / `ptop`](https://github.com/walles/px), `ps` and `top` for human beings
- [`riff`](https://github.com/walles/riff), a diff filter highlighting which line parts have changed

# Installing

## Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

**Both macOS and Linux** users can use Homebrew to install. See below for distro
specific instructions.

```sh
brew install moor
```

Then whenever you want to upgrade to the latest release:

```sh
brew upgrade
```

## Using [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/)

```sh
sudo port install moor
```

More info [here](https://ports.macports.org/port/moor/).

## Using [Gentoo](https://gentoo.org/)

```sh
emerge --ask --verbose sys-apps/moor
```

More info [here](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-apps/moor).

## Using [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)

Install `moor` with your [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers)
of choice or follow the instructions
[here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository) to install the
official way.

More info [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/moor).

## Debian / Ubuntu

In progress: https://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html

In the mean time, use Homebrew (see above) or read on for manual install instructions.

## Manual Install

### Using `go`

This will [install
`moor` into `$GOPATH/bin`](<(https://manpages.debian.org/testing/golang-go/go-install.1.en.html)>)
:

```sh
go install github.com/walles/moor/v2/cmd/moor@latest
```

NOTE: If you got here because there is no binary for your platform,
[please consider packaging `moor`](#packaging).

### Downloading binaries

1. Download `moor` for your platform from
   <https://github.com/walles/moor/releases/latest>
1. `chmod a+x moor-*-*-*`
1. `sudo mv moor-*-*-* /usr/local/bin/moor`

And now you can just invoke `moor` from the prompt!

Try `moor --help` to see options.

# Configuring

Do `moor --help` for an up to date list of options.

Environment variable `MOOR` can be used to set default options.

For example:

```bash
export MOOR='--statusbar=bold --no-linenumbers'
```

## Setting `moor` as your default pager

Set it as your default pager by adding...

```bash
export PAGER=/usr/local/bin/moor
```

... to your `.bashrc`.

# Issues

Issues are tracked [here](https://github.com/walles/moor/issues), or
you can send questions to <johan.walles@gmail.com>.

# Packaging

If you package `moor`, do include [the man page](moor.1) in your package.

# Embedding `moor` in your app

API Reference: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/walles/moor/v2/pkg/moor

For a quick start, first fetch your dependency:
```
go get github.com/walles/moor/v2
```

Then, here's how you can use the API:
```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/walles/moor/v2/pkg/moor"
)

func main() {
	err := moor.PageFromString("Hello, world!", moor.Options{})
	if err != nil {
		// Handle paging problems
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

After both `go get` is done and you have calls to `moor` in your code, you may
have to:
```
go mod tidy
```

You can also `PageFromStream()` or `PageFromFile()`.

# Developing

You need the [go tools](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Run tests:

```bash
./test.sh
```

Launch the manual test suite:

```bash
./manual-test.sh
```

To run tests in 32 bit mode, either do `GOARCH=386 ./test.sh` if you're on
Linux, or `docker build . -f Dockerfile-test-386` (tested on macOS).

Run microbenchmarks:

```bash
go test -benchmem -run='^$' -bench=. ./...
```

Profiling `BenchmarkPlainTextSearch()`. Try replacing `-alloc_objects` with
`-alloc_space` or change the `-focus` function:

```bash
go test -memprofilerate 1 -memprofile profile.out -benchmem -run='^$' -bench '^BenchmarkPlainTextSearch$' github.com/walles/moor/internal && go tool pprof -alloc_objects -focus findFirstHit -relative_percentages -web profile.out
```

Build + run:

```bash
./moor.sh ...
```

Install (into `/usr/local/bin`) from source:

```bash
./install.sh
```

# Making a new Release

Make sure that [screenshot.png](screenshot.png) matches moor's current UI.
If it doesn't, scale a window to 81x16 characters and make a new one.

Execute `release.sh` and follow instructions.

# TODO

- Enable exiting using ^c (without restoring the screen).

- Enable suspending using ^z, followed by resuming using `fg`.

- Retain the search string when pressing / to search a second time.

## Done

- Add `>` markers at the end of lines being cut because they are too long

- Doing moor on an arbitrary binary (like `/bin/ls`) should put all
  line-continuation markers at the rightmost column. This really means our
  truncation code must work even with things like tabs and various control
  characters.

- Make sure search hits are highlighted even when we have to scroll right
  to see them

- Change out-of-file visualization to writing `---` after the end of the file
  and leaving the rest of the screen blank.

- Exit search on pressing up / down / pageup / pagedown keys and
  scroll. I attempted to do that spontaneously, so it's probably a
  good idea.

- Remedy all FIXMEs in this README file

- Release the `go` version as the new `moor`, replacing the previous Ruby
  implementation

- Add licensing information (same as for the Ruby branch)

- Make sure `git grep` output gets highlighted properly.

- Handle all kinds of line endings.

- Make sure version information is printed if there are warnings.

- Add spinners while file is still loading

- Make `tail -f /dev/null` exit properly, fix
  <https://github.com/walles/moor/issues/7>.

- Showing unicode search hits should highlight the correct chars

- [Word wrap text rather than character wrap it](m/linewrapper.go).

- Arrow keys up / down while in line wrapping mode should scroll by screen line,
  not by input file line.

- Define 'g' to prompt for a line number to go to.

- Handle search hits to the right of the right screen edge when searching
  forwards. Searching forwards now moves first right, then to the left edge
  and down.

- Handle search hits to the right of the right screen edge when searching
  backwards. Searching backwards should move first left, then up and to the
  rightmost hit.
